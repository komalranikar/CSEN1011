1.Start
2.We will take the input of number of girls first and then for boys.
3.We need to check two conditions :- (i) Number of boys > number of girls.
						 (ii) Total sum of boys and girls should not be more than 10.
4.If the above condition does not satisfy we need to print "Invalid".
5.If the above condition satisfies, we need to continue.
6.make a function which find outs the factorial.
7.the number of ways in which boys can be seated is factorial of number of boys, and for girls not together in each other side is 
  number of spaces left for girls into minus of total number of girls.
  like if number of boys is 5 and girls is 3 to be fitted in 11 spaces then formula will be 5!*6*5*4.
