Algorithm to find whether the numberis prime or composite .
1. Start
2. Accept a positive integer 'num'
3. Initialize 'counter' with a value 2
4. Divide the number with the 'counter
5. If the remainder is 0 , display that the number 'num' is composite and exit.
6. Else increment the 'counter' and repeat from step 4 until the 'counter' value is less than 'num'.
7. After completion of all the steps , display that the number 'num' is prime.
